# Assignment #3 - ExpressJS, Routing and Templates

This assignment builds a book review website where you can review any book.  The input form takes the title of the book, the author of the book, reviewer's name and the review as input.  When the user clicks on the submit button, this application will display a page containing all the reviews of books thus far.

The application incorporates both the web based functionality as well as the REST API based functionality.

To access the Web base forms, please use the URL
base URL + /bookreviews  (ex. localhost:8090/bookreviews on my laptop)

To use REST based APIs, please use the URL
base URL  (ex. localhost:8090 on my laptop) 
When the base URL is invoked in the browser, the brower will load index.html in the public folder.   index.html executes javascripts in the public/js folder.  These scripts make use of the REST APIs to communicate with the node server.
