// Graduate Credit Assignment for CSCIE-31


This project incorporates security enhancements to my book reviews website that I created via Assignment 3.   The security enhancements make use of OpenID Connect protocol.  OpenID Connect is an open standard protocol for authenticating an user via a trusted Identity Provider (IDP) and for an application to get user’s profile from the trusted IDP based on user’s authorization to the IDP.   OpenID Connect is an authentication feature built on top of the OAuth 2.0 which is the authorization standard.


My book reviews website has the following fields:
Title
Author
Reviewer
Review

This project also auto fills the review’s field after the user signs into the website to review a book.
